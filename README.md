#  Rock Paper Scissors Program

I embarked on a journey with The Odin Project's Rock Paper Scissors lesson, but I decided to take it a step further by adding a dynamic feature: the ability for users to play any number of rounds they desire.

This project provided me with several valuable learning opportunities:

* Element Creation: I honed my JavaScript skills by creating and manipulating HTML elements dynamically.
* Event Listeners: I gained hands-on experience with event listeners, enabling user interactions within the game.
* Basic Bootstrap Integration: I dipped my toes into the world of Bootstrap, giving my project a (not so) polished look.
* DOM Manipulation: I delved into DOM  manipulation, allowing me to update and display game information seamlessly.

In hindsight, there are a few areas I'd like to improve upon:
* Navigating the Directions: My journey with this project became a bit of an extended adventure due to my initial misinterpretation of the instructions, fueled by my somewhat unfounded confidence. In what could be considered an unconventional move, I decided to forgo the typical approach of using my HTML document to create elements and, instead, embraced JavaScript's createElement method due to misreading instructions. Regrettably, this twist on the project inadvertently limited its full potential, leaving it somewhat short of the excellence I had initially aimed for.
* Element Creation: Instead of relying solely on JavaScript to create elements, I could have explored alternative approaches for a more efficient code structure.
* UI Design: While focusing on functionality, I should have devoted more time to enhancing the project's visual appeal, especially since design isn't my strong suit. Especially since we were called to make a UI.
* Resource Management: To develop stronger problem-solving skills, I realize that I should have struck a better balance between seeking external help (like consulting ChatGPT) and independently finding solutions.

This journey has been a valuable learning experience, and I'm excited to continue refining my skills and creating more engaging projects in the future.
